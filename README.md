# 42_Piscine_C04  
  
This repository contains solutions for the C 04 module of the C Piscine @ 42. In this project, we focus on manipulating strings and numbers in C, including converting strings to numbers and formatting number outputs in different bases. Below is a breakdown of each exercise.  
  
Exercises  
-  Exercise 00: ft_strlen  
Objective: Implement ft_strlen, a function that counts and returns the number of characters in a string.  
  
Prototype: 

        int ft_strlen(char *str);  

Learnings: Basic string manipulation and iteration.  

- Exercise 01: ft_putstr
Objective: Write ft_putstr, a function that prints a string to standard output.  
  
Prototype:

        void ft_putstr(char *str);  
  
Learnings: Using the write() system call and working with strings.
  
- Exercise 02: ft_putnbr  
Objective: Implement ft_putnbr, a function to display an integer on standard output.  
  
Prototype: 

        void ft_putnbr(int nb);  

Learnings: Handling integer outputs, including edge cases for int limits.  
  
- Exercise 03: ft_atoi  
Objective: Create ft_atoi, a function that converts a string into an integer.  
  
Prototype: 

        int ft_atoi(char *str);  

Learnings: Parsing strings and managing integer conversion, including whitespace and sign handling.  

# Conclusion  

The C Piscine C 04 project has been important for learning basic C programming skills, especially in working with strings and numbers. We learned how to count characters and change strings into numbers using functions like ft_strlen, ft_putstr, and ft_atoi. We also practiced showing numbers and changing them into different number systems with ft_putnbr_base. We focused on checking for errors and making sure our code works well. Using Moulinette for evaluation showed us how important it is to follow coding standards, helping us get ready for more advanced programming tasks.
