# 42_Piscine_C04  
  
This repository contains solutions for the C 04 module of the C Piscine @ 42. In this project, we focus on manipulating strings and numbers in C, including converting strings to numbers and formatting number outputs in different bases. Below is a breakdown of each exercise.  
  
Exercises  
-  Exercise 00: ft_strlen  
Objective: Implement ft_strlen, a function that counts and returns the number of characters in a string.  
  
Prototype: 

        int ft_strlen(char *str);  

Learnings: Basic string manipulation and iteration.  

- Exercise 01: ft_putstr
Objective: Write ft_putstr, a function that prints a string to standard output.  
  
Prototype:

        void ft_putstr(char *str);  
  
Learnings: Using the write() system call and working with strings.
  
- Exercise 02: ft_putnbr  
Objective: Implement ft_putnbr, a function to display an integer on standard output.  
  
Prototype: 

        void ft_putnbr(int nb);  

Learnings: Handling integer outputs, including edge cases for int limits.  
  
- Exercise 03: ft_atoi  
Objective: Create ft_atoi, a function that converts a string into an integer.  
  
Prototype: 

        int ft_atoi(char *str);  

Learnings: Parsing strings and managing integer conversion, including whitespace and sign handling.  

# Conclusion  

The C Piscine C 04 project has been an essential step in developing foundational skills in C programming, specifically in string   manipulation and numerical representation. Throughout the exercises, several key concepts were reinforced:  
  
String Operations: Implementing functions like ft_strlen, ft_putstr, and ft_atoi provided a deeper understanding of string handling in C.  The ability to count characters, display strings, and convert strings to integers is crucial in many programming scenarios.  
  
Integer Representation: The ft_putnbr and ft_putnbr_base exercises taught us how to display integers, including handling edge cases like   negative numbers and varying numeral systems. This knowledge is fundamental for creating user-friendly outputs in applications.  
  
Numerical Base Conversion: The ft_atoi_base function required us to consider different base systems, enhancing our understanding of how   numbers can be represented and interpreted in various formats. This is particularly relevant in fields like cryptography, data encoding, and  networking.  
  
Error Handling: Throughout the project, we encountered situations that required us to validate inputs and handle errors gracefully. Learning  to identify and manage invalid inputs is a vital skill in creating robust and reliable software.  
  
Automated Evaluation: The use of the Moulinette program for evaluation emphasized the importance of following coding standards and best  practices. Adhering to the Norm helped improve code readability and maintainability.  
  
In summary, the C Piscine C 04 project not only solidified our understanding of string and integer manipulation in C but also prepared us   for more advanced topics in programming. The skills acquired here will be invaluable in future projects and real-world applications,   reinforcing the importance of meticulous coding and problem-solving abilities.
